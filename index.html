          <p><i>Senior at <a href="https://www.uncw.edu">UNCW</a> majoring in
              <b>Computer Science</b> with <b>Digital Arts</b> concentration and
              <b>Data Science minor</b></i></p>
          <p>Hello, my name is Jamie Yang and I am a rising senior at UNCW this
            coming Fall 2022. I am currently staying with my parents in Seoul,
            South Korea over summer break as I take time to relax while learning
            about Web Devlopment. Through soe previous courses I took at
            school, I was able to gain some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            experience, but I felt it was extremely basic, especially with
            JavaScript, when I interviewed for an internship and I had no idea
            how to answer 90% of the questions. My hope for this course is to be
            able to gain a more solid knowledge of Web Development while also
            dipping my toes into all the different technologies and languages
            required for creating a complete website using both front-end and
            back-end development. Thank you for visiting!</p>
